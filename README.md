# Transliterate from English to phonetic spelling

This is a set of Python scripts that convert normal English writing into phonetic English writing using the EBEO orthography. It uses the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (CMUdict)](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict?in=singing+beats) to map normal English words to their phonetic versions.

## TODO

* Fix pronunciation of some words
* Idea: create a 'personalised dict' that only contains the words of the input string to be translated. This could reduce the chance of uncommon words reducing the quality of translation
